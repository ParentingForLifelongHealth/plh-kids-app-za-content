Today, we’ll explore how cooking can help your child learn maths while bonding together.\nStart by inviting your child to help prepare a snack, like making a pizza or a colourful fruit salad. As you gather the ingredients, ask them to count: 'How many grapes do we have?' This builds maths skills and encourages teamwork.\nNext, involve them in addition and subtraction: 'We need five grapes, if we have three, how many more do we need?' This makes learning fun!\nLet’s make it playful! Ask, 'Which is bigger: the grape or the apple?' This reinforces comparison skills.\nConsider planning a weekly cooking night. Cooking strengthens your relationship and builds your child’s confidence. Enjoy your cooking adventure together!"

Encourage them to string the beads, guiding them to sort by colour or shape if they’d like. Older kids may want to join in and try creating different patterns or spelling words out with alphabet beads.\nAs they string the beads, count together how many they’ve added. Celebrate their hard work by congratulating them on the beautiful misbah they’ve created! Remember, adult supervision is important when little kids are handling beads. Make sure the beads are large in size and that children don’t put them in their mouths as this is a choking hazard!\nWhat to look for: Notice how your child is learning about different colours and how they’re gaining better control of their hands, which helps develop dexterity.\nIt’s a simple, engaging activity that combines creativity, learning, and skill-building, all while having a great time!"

Your child should only follow the command if it starts with “Leader says”. For example, if you say, “Leader says jump\", they should jump. But if you just say “Jump” without the “Leader says” part, they shouldn’t move!\nEncourage your child to listen carefully and respond only when they hear “Leader says\". If they follow a command without it, gently remind them to pay attention and keep going for the next round.\nNow it’s time to switch roles! Let your child be Leader and give you the commands. \nThis playful activity is a wonderful way to practise listening, self-control, and quick thinking—perfect for getting your child engaged while learning important skills. Enjoy the fun of Leader Says together!"

You have unlocked a new play activity: Games with Pictures!\nThis activity helps spark creativity and language skills by making up stories from pictures.\nStart by showing your child a picture, and then say, “We are going to make up a story about this picture. I’ll start.” For example, you might say, “This little girl looks very excited today. Why do you think she’s excited?”\nEncourage your child to think about the picture and add their ideas. You could say, “She’s holding her bag and has a big smile. Where do you think she’s going?”\nLet the story unfold as you both take turns adding details. This activity boosts your child's imagination, builds their vocabulary, and helps them practise storytelling. The more pictures you explore, the more creative your stories will become!"

This fun activity will boost your creativity, improve emotional skills, and bring a smile to your face by focusing on positivity.\nHere’s how to play:\nStart by talking about the things that made you happy today. It could be anything—a friend, a favourite pet, a book, or even a game that made you smile.\nNext, choose at least three things that represent what makes you happy and place them in a special container or box. If you have more than three, go ahead and add them too.\nIf the things that make you happy are too big to fit in the box, or if you can’t find something to represent them, get creative! Use craft materials or building blocks to draw or build models.
