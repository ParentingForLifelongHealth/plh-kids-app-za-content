Parents can use a planned consequence when children don’t follow a rule or instruction. \n\nFor example if a child doesn’t follow the rule to come home from playing at 6pm, then a consequence could be that the child can’t go out to play the next day. \n\nGiving clear consequences teaches children that their actions affect themselves and others.",

But that just makes everything worse for everyone.\n\nIf we stay calm and give our children a consequence instead, they start to learn to take responsibility for their actions and we avoid the anger that comes with hitting or shouting.",
