But *how* we give instructions can make things more happy and calm at home.\n\nNegative instructions like, “Don’t touch that!” can make children feel bad. (They can make parents feel bad, too!)\n\nChildren are more likely to follow an instruction when it is worded in a positive way: \"Please only touch things that belong to us!\"",
