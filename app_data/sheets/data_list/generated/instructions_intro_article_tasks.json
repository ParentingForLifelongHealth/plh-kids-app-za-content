But *how* we give instructions can make things more happy and calm at home.\n\nNegative instructions like, “Don’t touch that!” can make children feel bad. (They can make parents feel bad, too!)\n\nChildren are more likely to follow an instruction when it is worded in a positive way: \"Please only touch things that belong to us!\"",

When we tell them “stop fighting” or “stop playing with your food”, they don’t know how to think about what we DO want them to do, only what we DON’T want them to do.”\n\nWhen you give a positive instruction, your child is more likely to follow it.",
