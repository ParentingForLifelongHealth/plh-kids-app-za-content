But I got interested when I learned what the benefits of praising could be.\n\nRight after learning about praise, I noticed my son doing what he does every day: Packing away his toys after playing. And I said “Thank you for packing away your toys, my boy, it really makes me happy that you are helping out to keep the house tidy.” My son was smiling and he even came to give me a hug, which he never does. \n\nThis praising business is hard. I still forget to do it sometimes. But praising really makes a difference. I never thought that a simple praise could make such a change in a person!"
