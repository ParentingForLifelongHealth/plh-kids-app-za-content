I was always shouting at her, and she was refusing to go to school. \n\nOnly when I started spending One-on-One Time with her, I realised that she did not want to go to school because she was being bullied at school. We sat down and used the four steps of problem solving. We identified the problem, and figured out solutions together: “What can I do as a parent so you can attend school and feel safe?”\n\nWe agreed I would go talk to the teacher to find a way forward. We really found the solutions together, and we are closer now.",
