Learning how to solve problems together with your child can help you prevent conflict in your home. \n\nIt also teaches your children how to solve problems on their own. \n\nThis will set them up for success throughout their life.

Why canâ€™t you buy me new shoes now?\n\nBy involving our children in solving problems, they learn to find solutions more and more independently. \n\nLife has its challenges. If you help your child solve small problems today, you give them the skills to deal with any bigger challenges later in life.",
